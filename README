Version 2.0

ChangeLog:
* Adding OAuth support instead of Basic Auth for fanfou, because fanfou.com will shut down its Basic Auth next year.

see http://ycflame.com/archives/540.html to learn how to deploy this application.

This application will sync all your tweets except RT and @ to fanfou and digu, and then to the big four SNS platforms in China —— Sina microblog, Tecent microblog, Douban and Renren.
